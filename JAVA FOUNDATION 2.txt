OPERATORS AND OPERANDS COMBINED TO FORM EXPRESSIONS
OPERANDS:
1.unary-acts on one operand
2.binary-acts on two operands
3ternary-acts on three operands

ARITHEMATIC OPERATIONS:
1.+  ->unary plus (binary addition)
2.-  ->unary minus(binary substraction)
3.*  ->multiplication
4./  ->divison
5.%  ->modulus

COMPARISION OR RELATIONAL:
	> checks whether greater than or not
	<  checks whether lesser than or not
	>= checks whether greater than or equal to 
	<=  checks whether less than  or equal to 
	==  checks whether equal or not
	!= not equal to

LOGICAL OPERATORS
 
 logical and-&&
 logical or-||
 logical not-!

ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
 =
SHORTHAND ASSIGNMENT
 +=
 *=
 -=
 /=
 %=
 
ex:
 variable=variable+exp; can be written as +=exp;

INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERTAOR

++  ->increment by 1
--  ->decrement by 1
 ex:
m=5
a=m++
first value of m is assigned to a
m is incremented by 1
a=5
m=6

ex:
m=5
a=++m
first m value will be incremented by 1
then m is assigned to a
a=6
m=6

TERNARY OPERATOR
