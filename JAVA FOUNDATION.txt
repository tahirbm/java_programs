JAVA-java is high level,object oriented ,reliable ,secured programming language
 features of java
  1.simple
  2.secured
  3.robust
  4.architectural neutral
  5.portable
  6.multi threaded
  7.distributed
  8.dynamic
  9.platform independent
  10.interpreted

java program section

1.Documentation section
2.package statement
3.import statement
4.interface statement
5.class definitions
6.Main method class
{
main method definition
}

FUNCTION-SUBPROCEDURE OR SUBROUTINE THAT IS IUSED TO P[ERFORM SPECIFIC TASK
METHOD-IT IS LIKE FUNCTION BUT IT IS DEFINED INSIDE A CLASS
STATEMENT-REPRESENT AN ACTION OR SEQUENCE OF ACTION

How to save compile and run a java program
--save: MyFirstApp.java using .java extension
--compile:  javac MyFirstApp.java
--run: java MyFirstApp

->JDK-JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT-develop and run java application
  ->JRE-JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT-run java application
    ->JVM-JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE -contains JIT COMPILER-JUST IN TIME
 
TOKENS-smallest individual units of program that are recognised by compiler
 types of tokens are:
	1.Keywords
	2.Identifiers
	3.Literals
	4.operators
	5.special symbols
--Keywords-standard predefined units
   there are 50 types of keywords 
--identifiers-identify various programming elements
   rules:
	*contains alphabets,digits,underscore and dollar symbol
	*doesnt begin with digit	
	*keywords cannot be identifiers
	*doesnt contain white spaces
--Literals-any constant value in program
--operators-symbols that are used to perform certain operations
   *arithmetic 
   *logical
   *assignment
   *ternary
   *relational
   *increment and decrement
   *bitwise operator

 NAMING CONVENTIONS
 *name of the package is written in small letters
 *each word of class names and interface starts with capital letters
 *first word of variables and method name is smal letter and from second word starts with capital letters
 *constants written in capitals
 *keywords to be written in lowercase

 DATA TYPES
 Two types
1.primitive-predefined and store individual values
2.non primitive-user defined
  
  -->primitive data types are
   	  *numeric 
	  *non numeric
    1.numeric has 1.floating point 2.integer
       --floating point:*float -4 bytes
			*double-8 bytes
       --integer: 
	*long-8 bytes -size is -2^63 to 2^63-1
	*short-2 bytes-size is -2^15 to 2^15-1
        *byte-1 bytes-size is -2^7 to 2^7-1
	*int -4 bytes-size is -2^31 to 2^31-1
    2.non numeric has 
        *boolean - true or false
	*character- char
  
    -->non primitive data types are
        *strings 
	*arrays
	*user defined classes

VARIABLES-Named memeory location whose value can change during the execution of programs
  syntax:datatype var1,var2,...var n;
   
Example:
   public class MyApp{
    public static void main(string[] args)
     {
     int a=10;
     float b=23.56f
    
     system.out.println("the integer variable is"+a);
     system.out.println("the float variable is"+b)
  }
}
